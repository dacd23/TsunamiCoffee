# TsunamiCoffee
Tsunami Coffee is a pretty straightforward website about a Coffee shop. The beauty of the website lies on the fact that it dynamically adjusts itself to size of the user devices' screen size. It fits all devices' screen sizes. The website was done whilst i was doing a Web Development course. It was one of the first projects I created.
